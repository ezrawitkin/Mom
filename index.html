            <p>I hope you have a fantastic 62 birthday!</p>
            <p>Thank you for being an amazing mom. It's been really helpful knowing I can reach out to you and you'll be supportive. I'm excited to see
                you over the summer! Hopefully we can go climbing together and make jerky using your dehydrator.
            </p>
            <p>I know people tell you all the time how impressive it is that you raised four kids as a single mom, but it really is incredible.
                You passed down values of kindness and tenacity to all of us. You're also so good at building a supportive network and getting help from others. I've learned a lot about how to ask for help 
                and build a support group from you.
            </p>
            <p>I hope you have an amazing time backpacking, and meeting up with people along the way.</p>
